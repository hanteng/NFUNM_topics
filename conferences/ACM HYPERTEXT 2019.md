2019 – the year of anniversaries: Time to reflect and look ahead.

* 30th Anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall 
* 30th Hypertext Conference 
* 30th Anniversary of the WWW 
* 20th Anniversary of the first ACM Hypertext Conference in Germany 

## CONFERENCE SCOPE

The ACM Hypertext conference is a premium venue for high quality peer-reviewed research on hypertext theory, systems and applications. It is concerned with all aspects of modern hypertext research including social media, semantic web, dynamic and computed hypertext and hypermedia as well as narrative systems and applications. 

The theme of Hypertext 2019 is _"HYPERTEXT – TEAR DOWN THE WALL"_. This motto of the 30th ACM Hypertext conference goes hand in hand with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Inspired by the historical events in Germany, Hypertext 2019 aims at reunifying different hypertext research directions and communities. Therefore, apart from the regular research tracks, Hypertext 2019 will feature a research track on 30 Years Hypertext as well as an exhibition/creative track. 2019 will also be the 30th anniversary of the WWW. It is a perfect time to join in, reflect our common roots, and discuss how we can jointly address our current and future challenges. 

The conference will take place at the Institute of Information Systems (iisys) at Hof University, Germany. Hof lies midway between Frankfurt and Prague, Munich and Berlin and is very close to the former German-German border, in particular to the village of Mödlareuth, called "little Berlin", which used to be divided by a wall. After exactly 20 years, Hypertext 2019 will take place in Germany again for the 2nd time. 

Hypertext 2019 is co-locating with the Adaptivity and User Modeling Workshop (ABIS'19), taking place on Sep 16 at Hof University, and with [ACM Document Engineering Conference (DocEng'19)][3] organized in Berlin, Germany, between Sep 23–16.

### TRACK 5: SPECIAL TRACK – 30 YEARS HYPERTEXT

Track Chair: Peter Nürnberg, USA

We invite submissions of a broad range of research focusing on reflections on or retrospectives of hypertext approaches and systems. Those should focus on "forgotten" issues, beneficial features, system behavior, or theories that were discovered, but are ignored by current systems. Contributions should be visionary and discuss those old ideas with a strong focus on today's information systems; they should conclude where and to which extent previously discovered ideas would enhance our current or future applications. 

## ADDITIONAL TRACKS

### POSTER SESSION

Chair: Ujwal Gadiraju, L3S Research Center, Germany ([@UjLaw][13])

Posters and demos will be presented during the conference. They target research and showcases in the above mentioned areas.

### EXHIBITION/CREATIVE TRACK

Chair: Mark Bernstein, Eastgate Systems, Inc., USA ([@eastgate][14])  
Curator: Dene Grigar, Washington State University Vancouver, USA ([@dgrigar][15])

The conference will include a creative track and exhibition, with readings and performances, workshops, demonstrations of both novel and historical systems, and innovative new work in electronic art and literature.

For the creative track, we invite submissions from all disciplines that engage with the expressive potential of hypertext, the link, and of social media-particularly those that address the conference theme of "tear down the wall".

The curated exhibition seeks hypertextual works of any length that explore new artistic forms, or that respond to or engage with older electronic literature. We are especially interested in location-aware and locative work that can be read in or near the conference site. We are open to work on any platform. Questions regarding creative work for the exhibition may be addressed to the curator.

Limited travel funds and bursaries may be available, as well as assistance and support for installation on site. Proposals for papers, panels, master-classes, workshops, and creative work for the exhibition should be submitted by 19 May 2019. 

### DOCTORAL COLLOQUIUM
