 ### Call for papers for MobileHCI 2019 “Bridging mobile across the world” 
 MobileHCI seeks contributions in the form of innovations, insights, and analyses related to human computer interaction and experiences with mobility and beyond. The conference series has shaped research, development, and practice in mobile devices and services for over 20 years.

  MobileHCI 2019 welcomes contributions related to any aspect of HCI technology, systems, devices, techniques, experience, application, methodologies, tools, theories, and new perspectives. Our interpretation of mobility is inclusive and broadly construed. In later calls we will solicit proposals for workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, and industrial case study papers.
 ##### Suggested Topics
 - MobileHCI seeks contributions in the form of innovations, insights, or analyses related to human experiences with mobility. Our interpretation of mobility is inclusive and broadly construed. Likewise, a contribution can encompass technology, experience, methodology, and theory—or any mix thereof, and beyond. This includes:
 - Systems and infrastructures. The design, architecture, deployment, and evaluation of systems and infrastructures that support development of or interaction with mobile devices and services.
 - Devices and techniques. The design, construction, usage, and evaluation of devices and techniques that create valuable new capabilities for mobile human-computer interaction.
 - Applications and experiences. Descriptions of the design, empirical study of interactive applications, or analysis of usage trends that leverage mobile devices and systems.
 - Methodologies and tools. New methods and tools designed for or applied to studying or building mobile user interfaces, applications, and mobile users.
 - Theories and models. Critical analysis or organizing theory with clearly motivated relevance to the design or study of mobile human-computer interaction; taxonomies of design or devices; well-supported essays on emerging trends and practice in mobile human-computer interaction.
 - Provocations and new perspectives. Well-argued and well-supported visions of the future of mobile computing; non-traditional topics that bear on mobility; underrepresented viewpoints and perspectives that convincingly bring something new to mobile research and practice.
 ### Submissions
 Authors of papers presenting systems and/or interaction techniques are encouraged to demonstrate their work at the conference – provided that a demonstration is feasible. The Program Committee will decide upon which paper should also include a demonstration. Papers need to be anonymised for blind review. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper. However, you do need to completely remove identifying information from the title/header area of the paper, and also make sure that it does not appear in the document’s meta-data. Citations to your own previous work must NOT be anonymised, so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account. Submissions will be managed through [Precision Conference (PCS).](https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login)
 ### Paper Length
 Papers should be between 4 and 10 pages long, and authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. References are not included in the paper length. If your research contribution requires only 4, 7, or 9 pages (plus references), please submit a paper of that length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportional to their contribution will be rejected. In exceptional cases, the authors may be requested to shorten papers for the camera ready stage. Shorter, more focused papers (akin to Notes or Short Papers in previous years) are encouraged, and will be reviewed appropriately.
 ### Format
 All paper submissions must be made in the SIGCHI papers format. As an ACM conference, MobileHCI papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library and citation indices.
 ### Presentation at the Conference
 Upon acceptance, you have to present your paper at the conference. At least one author of each paper must register. Presentation time during the conference will be allocated according to the weight of contribution. Papers that are 6 or fewer pages will have shorter presentation times at the conference. However, there will be no distinction made between papers in the program, proceedings or digital library. The exact talk duration will be determined when the program is finalised.
 ### Paper Chairs
